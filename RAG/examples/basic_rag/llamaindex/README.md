# Sustainable Farming & Cooking App

## Concept

This application promotes sustainable farming and cooking by providing users with personalized recipes, food storage strategies, and community-driven tips based on seasonal and local ingredients. It also integrates computer vision to identify vegetables from farm stand photos, emphasizing zero-waste cooking and supporting local farms.

### Key Features:
1. **Inputs**:
   - **Season and Location**: Suggests a list of seasonal vegetables.
   - **Vegetables of Interest**: Choose from the suggested list.
   - **Farm Stand Photo**: Uses computer vision to identify vegetables.
   - **Number of People**: Adjusts recipe portions.
   - **Dietary Restrictions**: Filters recipes to meet dietary needs.

2. **Outputs**:
   - **Recipes**:
     - Cook time.
     - Community notes and tips.
   - **Food Scrap Recommendations**:
     - Composting tips.
     - Freezing methods for future use (e.g., stir-fry mix, chopped fruit).
     - Zero-waste cooking ideas (e.g., carrot top pesto).
   - **Additional Features**:
     - Food donation resources, including Food Not Bombs drop-off locations.
     - Food lifespan and storage tips (e.g., using paper towels to extend the life of greens).
     - "Food as Medicine" insights:
       - Health benefits (e.g., turmeric for inflammation).
       - Spiritual properties (e.g., calming effects of certain herbs).

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- A simple web application that:
  - Handles inputs for season or vegetable list.
  - Outputs recipes, food scrap recommendations, and storage strategies.
  - Provides text popups for information on food donations and health benefits.

### Motivations:

2. Support local farms and markets.
3. Simplify eating natural, healthy foods.
